# Autonomous Vehicle Dynamics & Control Modeling 
This repository summarizes the assignments of the course vehicle dynamics planning and control of robotic cars offered by the University of Trento in the master program Mechatronics Engineering 


### Assignment 1 & 2 

The first 2 assignments are focused on using the Paceijka Magic Formula for fitting raw experimental data and analysizing the dynamic  behavior of the tyres of the vehicle. 

### Assignment 3 

The third assignment deals with analysing and processing data gathered through onboard sensors of the vehicle 

### Assignments 4 & 5 

The implementation of the dynamics of the vehicle is done in a Simulink model based on the frameworks already provided in the course by the lecturers. 
In the fifth, the behavior of the vehicle is analysed. 

### Assignment 6 & 7 

In the sixth assignment the lateral and longitudinal control strategies are explored and implemented by means of several reactive controllers on an already given trajectory. 
In the seventh assignment based on the RRT* planner the vehicle finds a path and follows it autonomously.
